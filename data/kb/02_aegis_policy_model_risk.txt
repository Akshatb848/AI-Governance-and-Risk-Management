AEGIS Model Risk & Governance (MVP)
- Fairness: compute Disparate Impact (selection rate ratio). Flag FAIL if DI < 0.80.
- Drift: use mean shift on top numeric features; flag REVIEW if drift score > 0.35 (heuristic).
- Explainability: produce global feature importance (SHAP) and store evidence artifacts.
- Document evidence + control outcomes; generate an audit PDF and trace logs for auditability.
